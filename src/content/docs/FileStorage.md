To keep its memory profile slim, LiteDB limits the size of documents to 1MB. For most documents, this is plenty. However, this is too small for useful file storage, so LiteDB provides `FileStorage`, a custom collection to store files and streams.

`FileStorage` uses two special collections:

- The `_files` collection stores file references and metadata:

```JS
{
    _id: "my-photo",
    filename: "my-photo.jpg",
    mimeType: "image/jpg",
    length: { $numberLong: "2340000" },
	chunks: 9,
    uploadDate: { $date: "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z" },
    metadata: { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
}
```

- The `_chunks` collection stores binary data in 255kB chunks:

```JS
{
    _id: { "f": "my-photo", "n": 0 },
    data: { $binary: "VHlwZSAob3Igc ... GUpIGhlcmUuLi4" }
},
{
    _id: { "f": "my-photo", "n": 1 },
    data: { $binary: "pGaGhlcmUuLi4 ... VHlwZSAob3Igc" }
},
{
   ...
}
```

`LiteStorage` contains the following methods:

- **`Upload`**: Sends a file from the hard drive or a Stream to the database, overwriting it if already exists.
- **`Download`**: Loads a file from the database and copies it to the given Stream.
- **`Delete`**: Deletes a file reference and all related data chunks.
- **`Find`**: Returns all file references matching a query. By default, searches the `_files` collection.
- **`SetMetadata`**: Updates the metadata of a file without affecting the file data. By default, updates the `_files.metadata` document.
- **`OpenRead`**: Finds a file by its ID and returns a `LiteFileStream` to read the file content.

```C#
// Get the default FileStorage
ILiteStorage<string> fileStorage = db.FileStorage;
// Get FileStorage with custom collections
ILiteStorage<string> fileStorage = db.GetStorage<string>("myFiles", "myChunks");

// Upload file from hard drive
fileStorage.Upload("photos/2014/picture-01.jpg", "C://Temp/picture-01.jpg"); // (FileID, SourcePath)
// Upload file from Stream
fileStorage.Upload("photos/2014/picture-01.jpg", "picture-01.jpg", inputStream); // (FileID, FileName, SourceStream, Metadata = null)

// Find file reference by its ID (returns null if not found)
LiteFileInfo<string> file = fileStorage.FindById("photos/2014/picture-01.jpg");

// Load and save file bytes to hard drive
file.SaveAs("C://Temp/new-picture.jpg");
// Load and copy file bytes to Stream
file.CopyTo(outputStream);

// Find all files matching pattern
IEnumerable<LiteFileInfo<string>> files = fileStorage.Find("_id LIKE 'photos/2014/%'");
// Find all files matching pattern using parameters
IEnumerable<LiteFileInfo<string>> files = fileStorage.Find("_id LIKE @0", "photos/2014/%");
```

**NOTE**: `FileStorage` does not support transactions, to avoid loading all of the file in memory before saving it to the hard drive. However, transactions are used to upload each chunk.
